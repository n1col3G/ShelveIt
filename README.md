These files contain the makeup of my senior project. ShelveIt! is a virtual library for users to add, customize, and organize book objects. 
Users may delete or continue to edit any book that is added. A friend function is also in place for users to send/accept/reject friend requests
and view the libraries of approved users. An admin account can be created within the database to monitor users.
